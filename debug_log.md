# Debug Log

## Performance Framework Tests Debug - [Current Date]

### Issue
Running performance framework tests revealed several failures:
1. Floating point precision issue in privacy overhead calculation
2. AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'name' in multiple tests
3. Missing json import in test file
4. Privacy metrics not being properly tracked

### Debug Steps & Fixes

1. **Privacy Overhead Calculation**
   - Issue: Test failing due to floating point comparison (49.999999999999986 != 50.0)
   - Fix: Updated test to use `np.isclose()` for floating point comparison
   - Status: Resolved

2. **Config Object Type Error**
   - Issue: Tests passing dict configs but framework expecting IntegrationTestConfig objects
   - Fix: Modified `run_performance_test` to handle both dict and IntegrationTestConfig inputs
   - Added type conversion: `config = IntegrationTestConfig(**config)` when dict is passed
   - Status: In Progress

3. **Missing Import**
   - Issue: NameError for json in metrics persistence test
   - Fix: Added `import json` to test file
   - Status: Resolved

4. **Privacy Metrics**
   - Issue: Privacy-specific metrics not being included in test results
   - Fix: Extended PerformanceMetrics class with privacy fields:
     - training_time
     - privacy_overhead
     - epsilon_spent
     - noise_scale
     - batch_processing_time
   - Status: In Progress

### Next Steps
1. Verify config conversion works correctly
2. Ensure privacy metrics are properly populated in test results
3. Add validation for privacy-specific metrics
4. Consider adding more granular logging for debugging

### Notes
- Most basic functionality tests are passing (5/12 tests)
- Main issues center around config handling and privacy metrics
- Consider refactoring test configs to use proper objects instead of dicts
