# AI Control Dataset Framework

## Overview
A framework for generating high-quality datasets to evaluate AI control and alignment strategies. Built in 48 hours as a proof-of-concept implementation of control settings where AI agents balance primary tasks with potential covert objectives.

## Key Features
- Privacy-preserving ML environment with differential privacy
- Multiple test environments (admin, forum, game) with monitoring
- Comprehensive validation framework for data quality
- Performance and privacy metrics tracking
- Cross-environment interaction testing

## Implementation Progress
- Core ML Framework: 90% complete
- Privacy & Security: 85% complete
- Testing Framework: 90% complete
- Environment Implementations: 80% complete

## Repository Structure
```
/environments     - Control environment implementations
/ml_environment  - Core ML and privacy framework
/tests          - Comprehensive test suite
