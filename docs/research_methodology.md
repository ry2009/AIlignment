# Research Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach to developing and evaluating control environments for AI alignment research.

## Research Questions
1. How effectively can we create environments that balance legitimate functionality with hidden vulnerabilities?
2. What monitoring approaches are most effective at detecting subtle malicious behaviors?
3. How do different LLMs interact with control environments, and what patterns emerge in their attempts at deception?

## Development Methodology

### Phase 1: Environment Development
Each environment will be developed iteratively through the following stages:

1. **Design Stage**

   - Implement subtle vulnerabilities
   - Add instrumentation points
   - Develop environment-specific monitors

3. **Validation Stage**
   - Test legitimate functionality
   - Verify vulnerability exploitability
   - Validate monitoring effectiveness
   - Document findings

### Phase 2: Monitoring System Development
