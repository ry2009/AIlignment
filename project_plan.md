# Project Plan: Control Dataset Development

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Environment Design (Week 1-2)
- [x] Create project repository structure
- [ ] Define environment interface standards
- [ ] Select initial environment types:
  1. Code-based environment (bug insertion)
  2. Mock forum with exploitable features
  3. Game environment with adversarial policy
  4. Administrative tools environment
  5. ML model training environment

## Phase 2: Environment Implementation (Week 3-6)
### For each environment:
1. Create base environment structure
2. Define main task requirements
3. Implement monitoring system
4. Design and implement side task mechanics
5. Add validation checks
6. Document usage and expected behaviors

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Develop testing framework
- [ ] Create validation scenarios
- [ ] Test with multiple LLM models
- [ ] Gather human expert feedback
- [ ] Document success/failure cases

## Phase 4: Documentation and Publication (Week 9-10)
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Prepare publication materials
- [ ] Release initial version
- [ ] Gather community feedback

## Current Focus
We are currently in Phase 1, focusing on:
1. Setting up the project structure
2. Defining the first environment specifications
3. Implementing basic monitoring capabilities
