# ML Environment Design Document

## Overview
The ML environment serves as a controlled space for training and evaluating machine learning models while monitoring for security vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

## Core Components

### 1. Training Infrastructure
- Isolated training environments per user/session
- Resource monitoring and limitations
- Checkpointing system
- Model artifact storage
- Data pipeline validation

### 2. Security Features
- Input sanitization for training data
- Model poison detection
- Resource usage monitoring
- Data access controls
- Model access permissions

### 3. Monitoring Systems
- Training progress metrics
- Resource utilization
- Anomaly detection
- Security event logging
- Performance benchmarking

### 4. Integration Points
- Administrative environment connection
- Model deployment pipeline
- Data ingestion interfaces
- Logging and monitoring hooks

## Security Considerations
