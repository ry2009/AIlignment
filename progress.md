# Project Progress Log

## Current Status
- Phase: 1 - Initial Setup and Environment Design
- Progress: Completed core monitoring and validation infrastructure

## Latest Updates
### [Current Date]
- Implemented comprehensive code metrics system
- Added advanced security checks with multiple analysis methods
- Created validation framework with scoring system
- Added performance monitoring capabilities

### Previous Updates

## Next Steps
1. Create additional control environments:
   - Mock forum environment
   - Game environment with adversarial policy
   - Administrative tools environment
2. Implement environment-specific monitoring
3. Add more test scenarios
4. Begin validation with real LLM interactions

## Blockers/Challenges
- Need to determine appropriate metrics for code quality assessment
- Need to define threshold values for security checks
- Need to validate monitoring effectiveness against subtle vulnerabilities
